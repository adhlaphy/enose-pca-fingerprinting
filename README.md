## Overview

Electronic nose (e-nose) systems use arrays of cross-sensitive metal-oxide
sensors to identify gases through pattern recognition rather than absolute
selectivity. This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the
UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset to:

1. Demonstrate gas-class discrimination in reduced PC space
2. Characterize sensor drift over 36 months across 10 temporal batches
3. Identify which sensors contribute most to chemical discrimination

## Key Results

| Finding | Value |
|---|---|
| Dataset size | 13,910 samples · 6 gases · 128 features · 10 batches |
| Variance explained by PC1 | 53.5% |
| Variance explained by PC1 + PC2 | 68.6% |
| PCs needed for 90% variance | 8 (16x dimensionality reduction) |
| Gas with largest drift | Acetone |
| Gas with least drift | Toluene |
| Most influential sensor (PC1) | Sensor 8 |

## Scientific Background

### The Cross-Sensitivity Problem
A single metal-oxide sensor responds to multiple gases — this is the
cross-sensitivity problem. The solution is to use an array of sensors
with different but overlapping selectivities, creating a response pattern
unique to each gas. This is the electronic nose principle, first
demonstrated by Persaud and Dodd (1982).

### Why PCA?
With 16 sensors and 8 features per sensor, each gas exposure produces a
128-dimensional feature vector. PCA finds the directions of maximum
variance in this high-dimensional space and projects the data onto a
small number of orthogonal axes, enabling visualization and discrimination.

### Sensor Drift
Metal-oxide sensor responses change over time due to surface contamination,
grain growth, and baseline shifts. This causes the PC-space cluster of a
given gas to shift position over months. Uncorrected drift degrades
classifier performance and is an open research problem.

## Methodology

```
Raw .dat files (10 batches, 36 months)
        ↓
Parse and stack → X: (13910, 128), y: (13910,)
        ↓
Z-score normalization (mean=0, std=1 per feature)
        ↓
PCA from scratch in NumPy — validated against sklearn to 8 decimal places
        ↓
Scree plot → 8 PCs needed for 90% variance
        ↓
2D scatter plot → gas clusters with 95% confidence ellipses
        ↓
Batch coloring → drift revealed across 10 time periods
        ↓
Centroid trajectories → drift quantified per gas over 36 months
        ↓
Loading analysis → Sensor 8 identified as primary discriminating sensor
```

## Figures

### 1. Feature Distributions
Single sensor features show heavily overlapping distributions across
all 6 gas classes, demonstrating that individual sensors cannot
discriminate gases and motivating the array-based e-nose approach.

### 2. Correlation Heatmap
High inter-sensor correlation confirms significant redundancy in the
128-dimensional feature space, justifying dimensionality reduction via PCA.

### 3. Scree Plot
PC1 explains 53.5% of total variance. Eight principal components
capture 90% of variance — a 16x reduction from 128 dimensions.

### 4. PCA 2D Scatter
Ethylene and Acetone form tight, well-separated clusters.
Ethanol and Acetaldehyde show partial overlap, consistent with
their similar chemical structures and surface reaction mechanisms.

### 5. Drift Visualization
Batch-colored projection reveals systematic displacement of all
gas clusters from early to late batches, confirming temporal drift
over 36 months.

### 6. Drift Trajectories
Centroid trajectories show consistent directional movement in PC
space. Acetone shows the largest total drift. Toluene shows the least.

### 7. Loading Plot
Sensor 8 contributes most strongly to PC1, identifying it as the
most critical sensor for gas discrimination in this array.

## Limitations

- PCA is linear and may not capture nonlinear cluster structure
- Drift is characterized but not corrected
- Ethanol and Acetaldehyde overlap is unresolved at the PCA stage

## Future Work

- Project 2: SVM and Random Forest classification
- Project 3: Drift compensation via subspace alignment
- Project 4: UMAP vs PCA comparison
